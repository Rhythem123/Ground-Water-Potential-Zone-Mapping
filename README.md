Groundwater Potential Zones in Mewat District, Haryana

Introduction

Groundwater is an important resource that significantly contributes to the total annual water supply. The purpose of this project is to assess and delineate the groundwater potential zones in Mewat, a southern district of Haryana. Satellite imageries and other collateral data are used to prepare thematic layers. Factors such as geology, geomorphology, slope, drainage density, lineament density, land use/land cover, soil, and Topographic Wetness Index are utilized. All thematic layers are integrated using a multicriteria evaluation technique. Weighted overlay index analysis is conducted to rank each parameter. Each thematic layer and its corresponding categories are assigned a priority-based ranking from 1 to 8, depending on their capacity to hold groundwater, and their respective weightages are calculated. The Raster Calculator tool is used to integrate the different thematic maps to produce a composite groundwater potential map of Mewat. The composite groundwater potential map is divided into five categories: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high groundwater potential zones. The motivation for this project is to identify areas where depleting groundwater can be saved by identifying low potential zones. The future scope of this project involves enhanced planning and management of this crucial groundwater resource to conserve it for future generations.

Conclusion
Assessment of groundwater potential is vital for the effective and efficient management of water resources. This study employs Geographic Information System (GIS), Remote Sensing Technology, and Weightage Analysis to identify groundwater potential zones by integrating various thematic layers, such as geology, geomorphology, slope, soil, topographic wetness index, drainage density, land use/land cover, and lineament density of Mewat district, Haryana, India. The resulting groundwater potential map serves as a base for planners in water resource management and land use planning.

Future Scope
